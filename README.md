# Web development midterm
## [Link to preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/XBShu/HTML-midterm/blob/master/index.html)
This repository contains my midterm project for my **"Introduction to web development"** class, which covers **HTML** and **CSS** as well as other skills necessary to develop web pages.

The goal of this project was to recreate a page given by the professor, which in this case was a paired-down version of the HuffPost main page --image below is what the professor was looking for. We were not provided any informaiton aside from this image. We had to provide our own styles, fonts, colors, JavaScript code, etc.
